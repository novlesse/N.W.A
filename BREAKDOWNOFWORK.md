#### Explanation

I collaborated with my team members in a group effort to design the database and implementing the schema using Flask sqlalchemy. I worked mostly on the templates, using Bootstrap to style different sections of the front-end such as making sure the album covers were accurately resized on user playlists. Prior to this project I had no experience with Flask and most technologies involved, so I had to do research on how to implement certain parts and pulling data from the database as well.
