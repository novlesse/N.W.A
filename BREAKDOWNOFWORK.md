Environment

Most of the work done was providing a MVP to work with. Added on the meat of the application through trial and error and redsigned the styling over a few iterations.

## John Nguy

### All Tasks

---

- Implemented AWS S3 
- Implemented Musixmatch and Last.fm API's 
- Wrote database queries 
- Collaborated in the design of the database
- Collaborated in using WTForms, Jinja

---

#### Explanation

Most of my work was focused on implementing the API's and pulling song lyrics and albums, Amazon S3 to handle larger file uploads such as mp3 files, and database queries into the server to pull and store data from the SQLite database. Hardest part was setting up many-to-many relationships in Flask SqlAlchemy as the structure is hard to wrap your head around. Being able to implement a working many-to-many join table into the server was a multi-day endeavour.

#### Explanation

I collaborated with my team members in a group effort to design the database and implementing the schema using Flask sqlalchemy. I worked mostly on the templates, using Bootstrap to style different sections of the front-end such as making sure the album covers were accurately resized on user playlists. Prior to this project I had no experience with Flask and most technologies involved, so I had to do research on how to implement certain parts and pulling data from the database as well.
